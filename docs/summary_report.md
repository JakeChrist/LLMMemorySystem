# 🧠 LLMemory Implementation Plan — Summary Report

## 🔹 Introduction

The **LLMemory system** is a local-first, reconstructive memory architecture for AI agents inspired by human cognition. It supports episodic, semantic, and procedural memory with emotion modeling and background dreaming for schema formation and long-term context reconstruction. It is pluggable, LLM-agnostic, and designed to help agents evolve their behavior over time.

## ✅ Features Implemented So Far

- 🧱 Modular folder structure scaffolded and zipped for immediate development.
- 🔌 Pluggable LLM interface design for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, LMStudio, etc.
- 🧠 Placeholder files for all core systems: encoding, retrieval, reconstruction, dreaming.
- 🪟 **Optional PyQt5 GUI**:
  - Three-panel layout: left (user inputs), center (LLM responses), right (agent state).
  - Dummy placeholders for memory, mood, and dreaming.
- 📦 Downloadable project ZIP with code templates and GUI included.

## 🔜 Next Steps

### 🔧 Core Memory System
- [ ] Implement `MemoryEntry` data structures with metadata, embeddings, emotion tags.
- [ ] Connect `encoder.py` to real embedding models (e.g., `sentence-transformers`).
- [ ] Develop `retriever.py` to return top-K relevant memories using FAISS or Chroma.
- [ ] Implement `reconstructor.py` to merge memory fragments into coherent prompts.

### 🧠 Emotion & Mood
- [ ] Add `emotion_model.py` logic using sentiment classifier.
- [ ] Use mood to bias retrieval and context generation.

### 🌙 Dreaming Subsystem
- [ ] Add `dream_engine.py` to run in background or on schedule.
- [ ] Summarize related memories, generate schemas, prune redundancies.

### 🤖 LLM Integration
- [ ] Implement each LLM backend wrapper (`openai_api.py`, `local_llm.py`, etc.).
- [ ] Use `llm_router.py` to dynamically select backend.
- [ ] Route agent output to selected LLM using reconstructed prompt.

### 🖥️ GUI Polishing (Optional)
- [ ] Make PyQt GUI reactive to real memory data.
- [ ] Add mood/dreaming visualization (e.g., color-coded or icon-based).
- [ ] Enable editing or exploration of stored memories from the GUI.

### 🧪 Testing & CLI
- [ ] Build `test_memory_workflow.py` to simulate full memory loop.
- [ ] Add CLI commands to query memory, trigger dreams, or reset state.
